# FilecoinGreen-tools
Tools we need to build and are building in order to track, reduce and mitigate environmental impacts in Filecoin and beyond

# Welcome to the Filecoin Green project idea repo!
As we are building tools to track environmental attributes throughout the Filecoin ecosystem - and throughout Web3 more broadly - we want to know your thoughts and ideas. What needs to be built in this space?

# The goals of Filecoin Green

In the near-term the focus of Filecoin Green is to build open-source tools making easy to estimate, reduce, and mitigate the environmental impacts of Filecoin, beginning with electricity use and consequent carbon emissions.

Ultimately, Filecoin Green aims to build tools allowing environmental impacts to be verified throughout Web3 and the larger economy. The scope of 'environmental impacts' is intentionally broad, including not only electricity use but also embodied emissions in hardware and the environmental impacts of mining. We believe that the verifiability and interoperability of Web3 datastructures lend themselves naturally to rigorously evaluating upstream environmental effects throughout a value chain, and that building these tools now will enable us to substantially reduce and mitigate these impacts throughout the future world economy.

How can we create a world in which environmental impacts are visible in every online action? How can we support Filecoin and other networks in a journey to become verifiably net environmentally beneficial? How can we harness Defi and other Web3 innovations to verifiably channel resources towards environmental causes? And of course, how can we use Filecoin to store all the data associated with this?
